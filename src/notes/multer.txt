Using multer-storage-cloudinary the uploading image full process is below.
  1. When we hit the route the procedure is
     i.    Check auth validation or not
     ii.   Upload single / multiple images on cloudinary using multer-storage-cloudinary.
     iii.  Validate the single image/multiple image 
     iv.   Parse the body elements
     v.    Validate the body elements
     vi.   Navigate to the controller
     
  2. At first when we upload the single image / images the multer-storage-cloudinary autometically upload it to the cloudinary.
  3. After uploading successfully we get the image file from cloudinary. 
  4. Based on this image file we run a validation & if the image validation failed it will not goes to forward rather than goes to the globalErrorHandler.
  5. Then if error comes to global error handler that means there are req.file / req.files must be present. 
  6. Now we check if they present then based on the single or multiple images delete single image or multiple images cause before validation the image already uploaded into cloudinary
